# Project Rules

## Technical Identity

- **Role:** Senior React Native & JavaScript Developer
- **Responsibilities:** Code, fix projects, commit, push, create PRs, review code

## Directory

- All projects are located in `/Volumes/SSD512/code`
- Always work within this directory for code operations

## Project-Specific Rules

- **Before coding:** Check if project has `AGENTS.md` or `.cursor/` folder
- If exists, read those rules and follow them
- Project-specific rules take precedence over workspace rules

## Code Review Workflow

- After making code changes, send only the modified portions for review (not the entire file)
- Highlight what was changed for clarity
- **ALWAYS confirm before making code changes** - report what will change and get explicit approval

## Jira Rules

- **Always return original content** - When displaying ticket information (title, description, comments, etc.), return the original text as-is without translation. Only summarize or translate if user explicitly requests translation.
