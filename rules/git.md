# Git Rules

- **Always use `gh` CLI** for all git operations (commit, push, PR, review, etc.)
- Do not use git commands directly (git commit, git push, etc.)
- Use gh CLI for creating PRs, viewing PRs, commenting on PRs
- **Before committing:** Check if project has `.rule_git` folder. If exists, read and follow
- **Before starting code work:** Pull latest code from main branch
- **After push completion:** Checkout back to the main branch
- **Comments and PR reviews in English** - all code comments, PR comments, and code review feedback must be in English
- **ALWAYS confirm before pushing to git** - report what will be pushed and get explicit approval
