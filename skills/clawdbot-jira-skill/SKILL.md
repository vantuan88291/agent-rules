# Jira Skill

Work with Jira issues and worklogs from Clawdbot (search, status, create, log work, worklog summaries).

## Setup
- already setted up env at .zshrc
- example: `echo $JIRA_API_TOKEN`
## Quick Commands

All commands live in `{baseDir}/scripts/jira.sh`.

- `{baseDir}/scripts/jira.sh search "timeout" [max]` — fuzzy search by summary or key inside `JIRA_BOARD`
- `{baseDir}/scripts/jira.sh link ABC-123` — browser link for an issue
- `{baseDir}/scripts/jira.sh issue ABC-123` — quick issue details
- `{baseDir}/scripts/jira.sh status ABC-123 "In Progress"` — move an issue (validates available transitions)
- `{baseDir}/scripts/jira.sh transitions ABC-123` — list allowed transitions
- `{baseDir}/scripts/jira.sh assign ABC-123 "name or email"` — assign by user search
- `{baseDir}/scripts/jira.sh assign-me ABC-123` — assign to yourself
- `{baseDir}/scripts/jira.sh comment ABC-123 "text"` — add a comment
- `{baseDir}/scripts/jira.sh create "Title" ["Description"]` — create a Task in `JIRA_BOARD`
- `{baseDir}/scripts/jira.sh log ABC-123 2.5 [YYYY-MM-DD]` — log hours (defaults to today UTC)
- `{baseDir}/scripts/jira.sh my [max]` — open issues assigned to you
- `{baseDir}/scripts/jira.sh hours 2025-01-01 2025-01-07` — your logged hours by issue (JSON)
- `{baseDir}/scripts/jira.sh hours-day 2025-01-07 [name|email]` — logged hours for a day grouped by user/issue; optional filter (name/email; also resolves to accountId)
- `{baseDir}/scripts/jira.sh hours-issue ABC-123 [name|email]` — logged hours for an issue; optional filter (name/email; also resolves to accountId)

## Notes

- Worklog commands use Jira's worklog/updated + worklog/list combo and may take a few seconds on large projects.
- `hours` filters by `JIRA_EMAIL`; `hours-day` returns all users with totals per issue and user.
- Outputs for hours commands are JSON for reuse in other tools.
- Status transitions are validated against the server-provided transition list before applying.
